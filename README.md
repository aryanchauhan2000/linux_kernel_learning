# Linux Kernel Development Learning Project

This repository contains my journey and experiments with Linux kernel development. The purpose of this project is to learn and understand the internals of the Linux kernel through hands-on development and experimentation.

## Project Structure

- `modules/` - Contains custom kernel modules
- `docs/` - Documentation and learning notes
- `examples/` - Example code and experiments
